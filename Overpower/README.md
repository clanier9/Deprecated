OverPower
==========

This is an online 2-player recreation of a collectible card game that I used to play as a kid. 
I began this during my Sophmore year of my Computer Science degree program and I chose Visual 
Studio due to how easy it was to create Windows and Frames using the GUI. I also found that I 
enjoyed .NET quite a bit. This project got to the point where I was able to play a full game, 
with several bugs, with another player who was located in Canada via a manually set up peer to 
peer connection. The project was abandoned shortly after because I had learned so much more in 
my schooling since beginning the project and also because there was a demand from the online 
community for a multi-platform version.

Starting halfway in my Senior year, I have started rebuilding this from scratch using Java which 
you can find it in my OverPower repository. The process has been painfully slow because I have 
taken on an "intern" of sorts. A friend that I go to school with wanted to get some real world 
experience, so I am using this project as a learning experience for him. He has no experience 
with github, or revision control of any sorts, and is still learning how to fully use Eclipse. 
He has had some experience with Java, but not on a grand scale. Using packages and overall 
project setup is also new to him.
